# Developement of different countries using PCA and Clustering/country data/Clustering/PCA

A renowned international humanitarian NGO is committed to fighting poverty and providing
the people of backward countries with basic amenities and relief during the time of disasters
and natural calamities runs a lot of operational projects from time to time along with
advocacy drives to raise awareness as well as for funding purposes.

After recent funding programmes, the NGO has been able to raise around $10 million. Now
the CEO of the NGO needs to decide how to use this money strategically and effectively. The
significant issues that come while making this decision are mostly related to choosing the

countries that are in the direst need of aid.

Our job is to categorise and group different countries using some socio-economic and health
factors that determine their overall development so that we can understand which countries
need the funding for their betterment and which donâ€™t. Therefore, we can make suggestions to

the NGO on the countries that they need to focus on the most.

We have applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensional reduction and K-
Means Clustering and Hierarchical Clustering to group the countries based on the similarities

in their features to determine which cluster of countries need aid from the NGO. To validate
the clusters, we have used Hopkins score as well as Silhouette score analysis.
